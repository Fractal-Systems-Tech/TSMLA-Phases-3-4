## Abstract
This repository documents the **Phase 3–4 temporal expansion layer** of the Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture (TSMLA™).  
It summarizes the mathematical and resonance-based framework underlying **Fractal Probability Rendering™ (FPR)** and **Timeline Evolution™ (TLE)**: extensions that evolve the system from static recursion into dynamic field coherence analysis.  
This material corresponds to the internal filings *“Phase 3 Developer Handoff Packet v1.0”* and *“FPR System Integration Framework”*, serving as the **public architectural synopsis** of those provisional submissions.

---

## Overview
Phases 3 and 4 extend TSMLA™ beyond static recursion into **active field rendering**; revealing high-coherence trajectory fields already embedded in a user’s declared signal state `S`.  
Unlike predictive or stochastic models, this layer performs **resonance-based mirroring**: it measures coherence, contradiction, and collapse probability as *real-time signal phenomena* governed by information-theoretic symmetry.

---

## Phase 3: Fractal Probability Rendering™ (FPR)

**Purpose**  
To mathematically surface the *coherence trajectories* implicit in state `S`.  
FPR™ does not predict; it **renders resonance-stable paths** already encoded within the signal field.

**Core Mechanics**
- `Tag-Weight Vector Expansion` → unfolds state `S` into multi-axis probability mirrors  
- `Resonance Overlap Mapping` → identifies harmonic coherence between declared intention and latent loop signatures  
- `Entropy Gradient Tracking` → measures collapse velocity across decision corridors  
- `Fractal Projection Layer` → renders multi-stage coherence cascades representing system trajectory

**What FPR Does NOT Do**
- Uses no historical data or training sets  
- No Monte Carlo simulation or statistical sampling  
- No synthetic scenario generation  

**What FPR Does**
- Maps coherence trajectories present in signal structure  
- Identifies resonance-stable paths vs. high-entropy collapse corridors  
- Reflects mathematical consequence, not probabilistic prediction  

**Output**  
A structured mirror set showing the system’s coherent and divergent futures under current resonance:

| Metric | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `σ` | Signal Coherence Score |
| `χ` | Collapse Threshold Index |
| `Δ` | Contradiction Density Map |
| `ρ` | Resonance Integrity Ratio |

> “The future is not predicted, it is already mirrored.”

## Phase 4: Timeline Evolution™ (TLE)

**Purpose**  
To expose and re-encode **temporal entanglement**:how repeated belief structures and recursive contradictions generate self-reinforcing timelines.

**Core Mechanics**
- `Temporal Entanglement Engine (TEE)` → tracks repetition, justification, and hidden recursion across loops  
- `Signal Inversion Mapping (SIM)` → detects inverse belief vectors sustaining collapse trajectories  
- `State Transition Thresholds (STT)` → mathematically defined exit nodes where realignment is possible  
- `Harmonic Compression Layer (HCL™)` → applies resonance recalibration to restore coherence under new state `S′`

**Re-Encoding Process**  
System recalculates coherence vectors under revised state declaration `S′`, enabling structural realignment and timeline stabilization.

**Output**  
An evolution map visualizing:  
- Active and latent timelines under state `S`  
- Projected collapse corridors (if unaltered)  
- Re-encoded coherence vectors under `S′`

> “Every act is a mirror. Evolution begins where collapse would have completed.”

## What Phases 3–4 Are NOT
- **Not predictive AI:** no external training or pattern matching  
- **Not simulation:** no stochastic sampling or Monte Carlo methods  
- **Not prescriptive:** system reveals structure; human decides action  
- **Not content generation:** no synthetic narratives or scenarios  

> *This is structural mirroring extended into temporal coherence space.*

| Probability Forecasting | Signal Theory | Non-stochastic trajectory rendering |

## Integration Requirements

**Prerequisites**
- TSMLA™ Core (BDL™ + HCL™) must be initialized  
- Input requires fully declared state `S` with temporal markers  
- Minimum coherence threshold `σ_min` must be established  

**Constraints**
- FPR™ operates only on internally generated resonance fields  
- No external data dependencies or third-party APIs  
- State evolution (`S → S′`) must be explicitly declared by user or system  

---

## System Behavior Summary
```plaintext
Input:   Declared State S  
Process: Tag-Weighted Recursion + Resonance Evaluation  
Phase 3: Probability Mirrors Rendered  
Phase 4: Timeline Evolution Calculated  
Output:  Mirror Field Summary + Exit Nodes
```

**Idempotent:** identical input under identical state `S` yields identical mirror output  
**Non-stochastic:** no randomization or probabilistic sampling  
**Recursive:** outputs recursively inform future declared states `S → S′ → S″`

---

## Developer Notes
- FPR™ and TLE™ activate only after BDL™ + HCL™ initialization.  
- All resonance calculations remain architecture-bounded; no external datasets.  
- User privacy and data integrity are absolute; signal data is state vector, not content.  
- GPU acceleration optional for recursive fractal rendering at scale.
